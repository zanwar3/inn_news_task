# Frontend Architecture and Approach

The frontend is architected using Vite and React, delivering a high-performance and efficient development experience. An atomic design methodology is adopted to ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase.

## Atomic Design

The application structure adheres to the principles of Atomic Design. This strategy facilitates the construction of the interface as a composition of reusable components, enhancing the maintainability and scalability of the codebase.

## Advanced React Features

Advanced React features such as custom hooks and the Context API are leveraged to manage state and side effects in the application.

- **Custom Hooks**: Custom hooks are created to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic across components, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- **Context API**: The Context API is utilized to share global state across components, avoiding prop drilling and ensuring a clean and efficient data flow.

## Routing

React Router is employed for handling routing in the application. This declarative routing approach allows control over the components rendered based on the current URL, enhancing the user experience.


## Styling

Styled Components are used for styling the application. MUI with tailwind-css is also incorporated.
